Update this rule if user requested changes to the project requirement, etc.
Everything looks well thought out and aligns with the project goals. I don’t see any major gaps, but before you proceed to generate the full documents, here are a few quick questions to consider:

1.  Mock ScreenTime API behavior • Do you want to define exactly how the mock API enforces limits (e.g., simply blocks the app or shows a warning)?
2.  Extension-approval rules • Should we specify the exact minimum number of approvals required (majority vs. fixed number)?
3.  Data retention and cleanup • Do you have a policy for how long to keep request history and audit logs?
4.  Error handling & retries • Should we outline how the backend handles failed push notifications or database errors?
5.  Future analytics hooks • Even if you’re not doing analytics now, do you want placeholders in the schema to make adding them easier later?

If none of these need adjustments, I’m good to proceed with the detailed PRD, App Flow, Tech Stack Doc, and Backend Structure Document. Let me know!
