# Summary Confirmation and Next Steps

Thank you for the clear summary. Everything looks correct and aligns with the project requirements and tech stack. Here’s how we can proceed:

## 1. Security Guideline Document  
   • Outline security principles tailored to this app (authentication, authorization, data protection, API security, etc.)  
   • Detail Supabase hardening, secure communication, input validation, rate limiting, and CSP/settings in SwiftUI.  

## 2. Detailed Implementation Plan  
   • Step-by-step instructions for each feature (database schema, SwiftUI screens, API calls, notifications, scheduled tasks).  
   • Include code snippets, folder structure, naming conventions, and best practices.  

## 3. Cursor Project Rules  
   • Define naming conventions, linting rules, and security-focused code checks for Cursor IDE.  
   • Automate enforcement of patterns (e.g., input validation, no hard-coded secrets).
