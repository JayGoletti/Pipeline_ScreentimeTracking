- Created a social accountability system with real-time notifications
- Established CI/CD pipeline for sustainable development

## Technical Debt and Considerations

- The ScreenTime API is currently mocked and will need to be replaced with the real API when available
- Push notification handling needs thorough testing on real devices
- The daily reset function needs to account for different time zones
- Consider adding offline mode support for basic functionality
